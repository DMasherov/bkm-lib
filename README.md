# Binary Model of Knowledge

## Introduction
"Binary Model of Knowledge" (BMK) is the system of concept-oriented languages intended for specifying and interpreting ontologies with their fact bases (instances). The BMK languages combine the advantages of frame-based object-oriented formalisms with well defined denotative semantics. 

BMK is being developed at National Research University "MPEI" (Moscow, Russia) and at Institute of Informational and Computational Technologies (Almaty, Kazakhstan). The program is currently under development and some languages of the BMK system have not been implemented yet.

## BMK languages
The system BMK includes the following languages:

- Language LSS for specification of object structure.

- Language LDT for definition of data types. Statements of LDT define abstract data types that are used, in particular, as domains of attributes.

- Languages LLS-0, LLS-1 for logical specification.

- Language LF of facts. LF includes the statements for inserting, deleting and updating facts.

- Language LQ of queries. Statements of LQ are queries to fact bases.

- Language LP of productions. Statements of LP are rules for transformations of fact bases.

- Language LTS for temporal specification. 

## Library structure

The project contains language parsers and algorithms for data storing, retrieving and logic inference.
